# React4j TodoMVC

[![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/react4j/react4j-todomvc.png?branch=master)](http://travis-ci.org/react4j/react4j-todomvc)

This repository contains several implementations of the [TodoMVC](http://todomvc.com/) application written using
[React4j](https://react4j.github.io). The project gives you an idea about what an application built using React4j
looks like.

The following variants are available:

* [arez](https://github.com/react4j/react4j-todomvc/tree/arez): State is modelled using
  [Arez](https://arez.github.io).
* [dagger](https://github.com/react4j/react4j-todomvc/tree/dagger): State is modelled using
  [Arez](https://arez.github.io), [Dagger2](https://google.github.io/dagger) is used for dependency
  injection. [arez...dagger changes](https://github.com/react4j/react4j-todomvc/compare/arez...dagger)

* This project was extracted from the [react4j repository](https://github.com/react4j/react4j) which was originally
  derived from the repository [GWTReact/gwt-react-examples](https://github.com/GWTReact/gwt-react-examples) before
  being heavily modified. Credit goes to Paul Stockley and other contributors to the `gwt-react` projects who this
  repository was originally based on.
