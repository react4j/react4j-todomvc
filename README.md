# React4j TodoMVC variant using Bazel

[![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/react4j/react4j-todomvc.png?branch=raw_bazel)](http://travis-ci.org/react4j/react4j-todomvc)

This [TodoMVC](http://todomvc.com/) implementation is written using:

* [React4j](https://react4j.github.io) for the view layer.
* [Bazel](https://bazel.build/) as the build system.

## Notes

The dependencies are generated by using the command:

    .../bazel-deps/gen_maven_deps.sh generate --repo-root `pwd` --sha-file 3rdparty/workspace.bzl --deps dependencies.yaml  --buildifier /usr/local/bin/buildifier

## TODO

* Enhance or re-write [bazel-deps](https://github.com/johnynek/bazel-deps) so:
  - it allows passing in `omit_` properties to avoid loading specific deps.
  - no need to specify lang in `dependencies.yml` when derivable.
  - caches files somewhere more sensible so that task runs a lot faster
  - extracts processor from jars automagically
  - add supports for explicit exports/excludes for dependencies. Seems to be broken atm.

* add processing of `dependencies.bzl` to zim for dependency upgrades

* add processing of `dependencies.bzl` to arez/react4j/spritz for dependency upgrades during releases

* Split the generation of .war and generation of gwt output into separate bazel targets
* Make it possible to disable GWT dev mode for a gwt application and just do gwt compile

* Remove `WEB-INF/lib/` from war output

* Consider helping maintain https://github.com/bazelbuild/rules_gwt

* Add documentation and examples from

  https://github.com/tadeoj/nalu-bazel-example
