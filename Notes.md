# How to build

First you need to install updated build tools that does not copy the `*/public/` assets into
the directory used by j2cl compile. To install build tools locally do:

    > git clone https://github.com/realityforge/j2cl.git
    > cd j2cl
    > git checkout NoCopyPublicAssets
    > mvn clean install

## BUNDLE Mode

To compile in bundle mode simply open up the `pom.xml` and change `--compilation_level=ADVANCED` to
`--compilation_level=BUNDLE` and then run `./build.sh`.

## ADVANCED Mode

The `ADVANCED` mode currently does not work as the process is not using the externs for some reason.
The externs are located at `src/main/externs/react.externs.js` and are configured in the `pom.xml`.
However running `./build.sh` results in `ERROR - Required namespace "React.Component" never defined.`
errors. It is probable that the externs are not exactly aligned with the java code but it is until
they are accepted by closure compiler it is difficult to track down the specific problem.

# Future TODO

* Consider compiling react with closure-compiler
  - https://github.com/facebook/react/pull/11967/files
  - https://github.com/tadeegan/react-closure-sample
* Experiment with Bazel - https://github.com/bazelbuild/rules_closure
* https://github.com/Axellience/vue-gwt-demo/blob/feature/j2cl/pom.xml

# Change Notes

These are short-hand notes of the changes that were needed to get this "working".

* Add both `.java` and `.class` files for annotation libraries. GWT2.x only required .class files
  and never processed them unless on source code path.
* Annotation libraries now need to compilable under j2cl - previously not the case. Primarily this impacted
  libraries such as `com.google.code.findbugs:jsr305:jar`. It uses several jre only features so instead of
  trying to fix that library I just extracted a j2cl compatible library `org.realityforge.javax.annotation:javax.annotation:jar`
  that included a few commonly used annotations (i.e. `@Nonnull`, `@Nullable` and `@Generated`).
* As annotation processors were moved off the classpath onto processor classpath.
* Some annotation processors had not been shaded and now needed to be. Previously when annotation
  processors were only on the classpath, each module would only have a processor and it deps on the
  classpath if it was needed. However due to limitations of some tooling (hello Intellij IDEA+maven),
  sometimes when adding to processor path, the processor would be visible to multiple compiles and if
  the processors have incompatible dependencies this would be an issue.

## Jsinterop changes

* The `@JsConstructor` annotation needed to be added to the constructor of the `react4j.core.NativeComponent`
  class and to the constructors of all subclasses, including those generated by the annotation
  processor. This is to satisfy J2CL which has stricter requirements with respect to the jsinterop
  annotations.
* `@JsType( isNative = true )` to `@JsType( isNative = true, namespace = JsPackage.GLOBAL, name = "Object" )`
  In GWT2.x if the objects were created by the javascript library and passed to java it did not matter.
* Change the namespace the jsinterop typing of the `React` class from
  `@JsType( isNative = true, namespace = "React", name = "Component" )` to
  `@JsType( isNative = true, namespace = JsPackage.GLOBAL, name = "React.Component" )` as J2CL only considers
  types with a namespace of `JsPackage.GLOBAL` to be capable of being externs.
* Rework the way compile time constants are processed to be compatible with j2cl - see
  https://github.com/realityforge/braincheck/commit/832c2e7e862196f72afd5569695041d331d9aae2

## Externs/Closure specifics  
  
* Find and include externs.
* Many places needed to add the equivalent of `goog.define('goog.DEBUG', true);` for own compile time constants.
  These have been stripped out but will need to be added back in to get `ADVANCED` mode working.
